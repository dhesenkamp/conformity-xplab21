This repository contains an online experiment aiming to replicate the study conducted by Pryor et al. (2019), built using [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html).

Original experiment:
Pryor C, Perfors A, Howe PDL (2019) Conformity to the descriptive norms of people with opposing political or social beliefs. PLOS ONE 14(7): e0219464.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219464

Besides the actual code used to implement experiment 1 of the above paper, this repository also contains
- the analysis script including the (anonymized) data
- the experimental design, materials, preregistration, and final report.
