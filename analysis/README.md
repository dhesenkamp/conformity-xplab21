# Analysis

This subfolder contains all relevant files for the statistical analysis of the experiment, i.e. the collected data (anonymised) and the analysis script including all functions used. The script is strongly based on the analysis originally run by Perfors & Prior (2019). 

This link leads directly to their repository (as also mentioned in their publication): [osf.io/tgf96/](https://osf.io/tgf96/)

Subfolders:
pilot: contains fictitious data and analysis of pilot study
final: same as above, but from final run of the experiment & with data gathered from real subjects

Analysis script from pilot & final slightly differ as the data was in a different format (only two unimportant columns differ).
