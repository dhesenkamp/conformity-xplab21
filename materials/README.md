# Materials

This folder contains materials used for the implementation of the experiment.

The materials stored in 'materials_german.pdf' were used in the experiment and the materials in 'materials_english.pdf' serve as a translation of the German materials. 

The moral dilemma that was employed in the study is the same that was used by Pryor et al. (2019) and it can also be found in their [OSF repository](https://osf.io/tgf96/).
